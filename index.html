<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Callum Evans. I am a student at City of Glasgow College, and I am here studying NQ Computing and Digital Media, and this is my website! I created this website to demonstrate the many skills that I have learned here at City of Glasgow College, as well as showing off some of my work and other information about myself, such as my goals at City of Glasgow College and my aspirations for the future. I hope that this website will help you get some insight into all the great skills you can learn in computing. From website development to animation, there is sure to be something that's right for you! So have a look around and learn all about City of Glasgow College.</p>
